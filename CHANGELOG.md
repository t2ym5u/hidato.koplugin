## [1.1.8] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- Generated puzzles had no uniqueness verification — clues were revealed
  as a random fraction of the solved path with no check that the
  remaining givens still pinned down a single Hamiltonian path, so some
  puzzles admitted more than one valid solution even though only one
  was recognized as correct. Generation now digs clues one at a time
  and keeps a cell hidden only after proving with a bounded backtracking
  search that exactly one solution remains, guaranteeing every puzzle
  has a unique solution.
