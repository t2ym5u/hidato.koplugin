All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Hint** button. Two taps, not one: the first says which cell is about to
  give, the second acts on it -- a player who is told where to look usually
  finds the rest themselves, and only pays for the full reveal if they want
  it. A cell that contradicts the solution is always reported before a fresh
  one is revealed, and on a mistake the hint empties the cell rather than
  solving it.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- Generated puzzles had no uniqueness verification — clues were revealed
  as a random fraction of the solved path with no check that the
  remaining givens still pinned down a single Hamiltonian path, so some
  puzzles admitted more than one valid solution even though only one
  was recognized as correct. Generation now digs clues one at a time
  and keeps a cell hidden only after proving with a bounded backtracking
  search that exactly one solution remains, guaranteeing every puzzle
  has a unique solution.
